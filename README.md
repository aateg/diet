# nutri-score

This program is a simple nutrition tracker (I'm planning to rename later). 

## Goal
The idea is to track the calories and the balance of nutrients through data visualization. 
But in order to get that you need to input the data :). 

## Usage
First things first: you need to have sqlite3 for this.

I created the file `settings.py` that will create the databases need for the project in the current directory.

After that you only have to keep databases updated by running the programs as shown bellow:

### Adding food nutrients

### Adding daily meals

# TODO
